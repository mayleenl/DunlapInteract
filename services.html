              <h3>Why Volunteer?</h3>
              <p>You already know that volunteering is all about helping others, but why else should we do it? You're given two choices: watching TV on a Saturday morning or helping to feed families by packaging crisis food boxes for those impacted by natural disasters. Volunteering develops character and integrity while making a difference in the world, and your TV will still be there when you get back. It's also important to give your life a larger purpose: volunteering is fulfilling and improves social skills and connections within the community. You'll learn new skills and knowledge, gain an understanding of other people and cultures, and enrich your high school experience. Moreover, you will get first-hand work experience, hours, and help you stand out in the college admissions process.</p>

            <h3>All About Rotary</h3>
            <form class="quote">
              <p>Rotary is an international organization dedicated to providing service to others, promoting integrity, and advancing world understanding, goodwill, and peace, through the fellowship of business, professional, and community leaders. The organization was founded to allow people with diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas and inflict positive change in their community. Interact club is an extension of Rotary at the school level and is founded on the same principles. Dunlapâ€™s Interact Club works under the same mission as Rotary, with a specific focus in developing leadership and personal integrity along with taking action in the school and community.

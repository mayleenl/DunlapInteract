              In Interact, we can make more than a difference. Beyond accumulating service hours, we are here to make a difference in the community and help each individual to develop leadership and personal integrity. At Dunlap Interact Club, we are here to develop leadership and personal integrity, take action in the school and community, network and build connections in community, and advance community understanding and goodwill.
              <br/><br/>Join us at our monthly club meetings on Thursdays. Access the Remind at the link above for updates and announcements. In the Google Drive, find the event calendar and monthly overviews if you missed a club meeting.
              <br/> <br/>Our club sponsor is Mr. Olson, whose classroom is located in N14.
